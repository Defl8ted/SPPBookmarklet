# How to install the bookmarklet


THIS TUTORIAL WAS MADE ON FOR CHROME OS. HOWEVER, THE STEPS ARE STILL VERY SIMILAR ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW ALONG STILL.
1. Click the School Specialty vX under Releases tab in the right middle of the screen.

7. It should be now on your computer. Nice job! Open the folder you just imported (it may be in your Other Bookmarks bar) and drag the School Specialty folder out of it and place it on your bookmarks bar. (Ctrl + Shift + B to activate your bookmarks bar if it is off).

Congratulations! You now have the School Specialty Bookmarklet installed on your browser. Just click the School Specialty folder and you should see a bunch of other folders. Click your desired folder and click any of the bookmarklets inside to use them.

They look like this.
WARNING: Some bookmarks may not work!!! Also, they do not work on all web pages, like the new tab page for instance.
WARNING: SPPBookmarklet is not responsible for anyone getting in trouble with supervisors, as this is made just for fun. Also, it is very possible you may be blacklisted from using some accounts on specific websites when using some bookmarklets (ex. Blooket Hacks), so be careful, and report any bans as an issue with the specific bookmarklet. Enjoy!

HAVE FUN!!!
